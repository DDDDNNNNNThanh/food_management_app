# FOOD MANAGEMENT APP
This is a project that my group ( Group 8 ) in Python class has done for our project.
This app is about: 

* Food management.
* Calories counting
* Adding and deleting your favorite food
* Counting macro of ingredients 
* Body physical index
* Manage expiration date 
* Suggestion menu and cooking recipe 

## TARGET
This app will help you discover food in the refrigerator and manage your shopping for the entire week. For users who are perplexed about how to manage the food in their storage, our app is a nutrition and healthy enhancement tool. This will give you a clear view of the storage by displaying the food management and calculating the calories consumed, macro, for the entire meal. Additionally, our app offers menu suggestions and a body indicator review. This tools tracks your calories and provides advise regarding the macronutrients on your plate, making it particularly useful for those who are on a diet to optimize overall health.
